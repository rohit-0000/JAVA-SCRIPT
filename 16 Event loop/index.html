<!-- 
synchronous code : code which are executed on same time.
Asynchronous code : code which doesnot execute at same time or take some time than other code
Blocking : code after asynchronous code stop executing due to asynchronous code 
Event loop: we use to handle asynchronous code using event loop to prevent blocking.
            it include three components.
            1) call stack
            2) Browser
            3) callback queue
eg:- we have code like
                    console.log("start");
                    setTimeOut(sayMYname,5000);
                    console.log("end");
in this 1st and last line in synchronous code and 2nd or middle linke is asynchronous code
any code first go to call stack if synchronous execute 
if asynchronus call stack pass that code to browser and other code executes.
i.e setTimeOut(sayMyName,500); passes to browser and time counting start in brower. 
if time complete then asynchronous code go from browser to callback Queue.
and then if call stack is empty then code passes from queue to stack and execute
and another code exexute
